# FIle-Q-A-RAG-Chatbot
This code sets up a Streamlit-based file question-answer chatbot using LangChain to perform retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from uploaded PDF documents. The app allows users to upload PDFs, processes those files into chunks, and then retrieves relevant information from the documents to answer user questions using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.
